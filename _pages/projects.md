<h4><b>Decision Optimization in Cricket Gameplay</b></h4>

In the dynamic world of cricket, making the right decisions on each ball can be the difference between victory and defeat. This project was dedicated to enhancing decision-making in cricket gameplay scenarios by leveraging principles from Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Here's a summary of our key accomplishments:

<ul>
<li>Contextualizing Cricket Gameplay:
The project aimed to provide an optimal action in various in-game situations. To achieve this, the focus was on modeling the game setting as an MDP.
</li>

<li>MDP Conversion: 
The project transforms the intricate dynamics of a cricket game into a formal Markov Decision Process. This conversion process allows to mathematically represent the transitions between game states, enabling more structured decision-making.
</li>

<li>Algorithm Implementation:
One of the core contributions of the project was the implementation of various MDP solution algorithms, including Value Iteration and HPI (Howard's Policy Iteration), from scratch. These algorithms played a pivotal role in determining the optimal actions in different cricket gameplay scenarios.
</li>

<li>Decision Optimization: 
The work ultimately led to the optimization of decision-making in cricket. By applying MDP techniques and the custom-built algorithms, the algorithm recommended optimal actions based on the given probabilities of different outcomes for specific actions in the game.
</li>
</ul>

<h4><b>Regret Minimization in Multi-Armed Bandit Problems</b></h4>

In the realm of decision-making under uncertainty, multi-armed bandit problems serve as a quintessential challenge. Our project was dedicated to devising effective strategies for minimizing regret â€“ the difference between the reward accumulated by an algorithm and the maximum achievable reward. Here are the key highlights of the work

<ul>
<li>Algorithm Diversity: 
The project confirms the theoretic logarithmic upper bounds on regret for different algorithms including UCB (Upper Confidence Bound), KLUCB (Kullback-Leibler Upper Confidence Bound), and Thompson Sampling. These algorithms formed the backbone of our approach, enabling us to explore various avenues for regret minimization.
</li>

<li>Batch Thompson Sampling:
An innovative aspect of the project involved the implementation of Thompson Sampling in a batch setting. This adaptation was aimed at minimizing regret when samples are taken in batches. 
</li>

<li>Addressing Special Cases: 
The project addressed a unique scenario in bandit problems where the number of arms matches the horizon. In such cases, we provided a straightforward yet effective approach to minimize regret, ensuring that even under these specific constraints, our strategies remained optimized.
</li>
</ul>
