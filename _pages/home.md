### Welcome!

Hello, I’m **Sarvesh Gharat**, a Ph.D. student at the *Centre for Machine Intelligence and Data Science (CMInDS), IIT Bombay*. My research lies at the intersection of **online learning theory and generative AI**, with a focus on how intelligent systems learn and make decisions efficiently under uncertainty.

I work primarily on **multi-armed bandits, reinforcement learning, and inference-time algorithms for large language models (LLMs)**. A central theme of my research is cost-aware and data-efficient decision-making — for example, identifying the best LLM for a task or improving model reasoning under practical constraints such as limited compute, feedback, or supervision. This perspective connects learning theory with real-world deployment challenges in modern AI systems.

More recently, I have developed a growing interest in **LLM alignment and multi-agent systems**. I am particularly interested in how artificial agents interact, cooperate, and compete in complex environments, and how alignment strategies can make these systems more reliable, robust, and aligned with human goals. These directions bridge online learning, reinforcement learning, and large-scale AI systems.

I have had the privilege of working with outstanding mentors and collaborators across academia and industry, including internships at **Google DeepMind** and **Adobe Research**. At DeepMind, I worked on AI for social impact, studying the effectiveness of AI-driven interventions in public health programs. At Adobe Research, I focused on inference-time techniques to improve LLM reasoning under fixed compute constraints, including adaptive example selection and sequential test-time scaling.

My work has appeared in venues such as **ICASSP, MNRAS, and AAMAS**, and I actively contribute to the research community through reviewing and collaborations across machine learning and AI for science.

Outside of research, I enjoy probability theory for the elegance it brings to modeling uncertainty. I am also passionate about sports — particularly football and cricket — which I value for the teamwork, strategy, and competitive spirit they foster.

I’m always happy to connect with researchers and practitioners interested in online learning, LLMs, and AI systems.
