### Welcome!

Hello, I’m **Sarvesh Gharat**, a Ph.D. student at the Centre for Machine Intelligence and Data Science (CMInDS), Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay). I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from VIIT Pune, where I built a strong foundation in engineering and applied mathematics.

My research lies at the intersection of **online learning and generative AI**. In online learning, I focus on **multi-armed bandits and PAC decision-making**, studying how to make reliable decisions under uncertainty. In generative AI, I apply these principles to **large language models (LLMs)** — developing methods to identify the best models for a task and to improve reasoning through efficient prompting and inference-time strategies.

More recently, I’ve developed a growing interest in **LLM alignment and multi-agent systems**. I’m particularly interested in how artificial agents interact, cooperate, and compete in complex environments, and how alignment techniques can make these systems more robust, reliable, and aligned with human goals. These directions bridge learning theory, reinforcement learning, and real-world AI deployment.

I’ve been fortunate to work with inspiring mentors and collaborators, including internships at **Google DeepMind** and **Adobe Research**, which have shaped my perspective on both theoretical and applied AI research.

Outside of academia, I enjoy probability theory for the elegance it brings to understanding uncertainty. I’m also passionate about sports — especially football and cricket — which I value for the teamwork, strategy, and competitive spirit they foster.

I’m grateful for the opportunities and guidance that have shaped my journey so far, and I’m excited to continue exploring new directions in AI research.
