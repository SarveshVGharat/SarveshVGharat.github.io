### Welcome!

Hello, I'm Sarvesh Gharat, and I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D. at Centre for Machine Intelligence and Data Science, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay). I completed my Bachelor's degree in Technology (B.Tech) in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at VIIT Pune, where I cultivated a strong foundation in engineering and science.

My academic journey now revolves around Online Learning, Deep Learning, and Observational Astronomy. In the realm of Online Learning, I specialize in multiarmed bandits particularly in the PAC settings, exploring decision-making strategies. I also venture into Observational Astronomy, where I use deep learning techniques including traditional architectures to transformers, along with statistical analysis to decode complex celestial data.

Besides my academic pursuits, I have a passion for probability and enjoy delving into its intricacies. When I'm not immersed in research, you'll often find me on the football or cricket field, enjoying the thrill of these sports.

I'm grateful to have some awseome mentors in past along with the opportunities that have come my way, having received Ph.D. offers from all the universities I applied to. I'm excited to continue my academic journey and explore new horizons in research.

Thank you for visiting my corner of the web. Feel free to explore my academic interests and reach out if you share a passion for any of these areas. 

Let's connect and learn together.
