### Welcome!

Hello, I'm Sarvesh Gharat, and I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D. at Centre for Machine Intelligence and Data Science, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay). I completed my Bachelor's degree in Technology (B.Tech) in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at VIIT Pune, where I cultivated a strong foundation in engineering and science.

My academic journey now revolves around Online Learning and Generative AI. In the realm of Online Learning, I specialize in multiarmed bandits particularly in the PAC settings, exploring decision-making strategies. I also venture into Generative AI, wherein I use online learning techniques to identify optimal LLMs to finetune for a particular task while using the appropriate prompt.

Besides my academic pursuits, I am passionate about probability and enjoy delving into its intricacies. When I'm not immersed in research, you'll often find me on the football or cricket field, enjoying the thrill of these sports.

I'm grateful to have some awesome mentors in past along with the opportunities that have come my way, having received Ph.D. offers from all the universities I applied to. I'm excited to continue my academic journey and explore new horizons in research.

Thank you for visiting my corner of the web. Feel free to explore my academic interests and reach out if you are passionate about any of these areas. 

Let's connect and learn together.
