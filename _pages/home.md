### Welcome!

Hello, I’m Sarvesh Gharat, and I’m currently pursuing my Ph.D. at the Centre for Machine Intelligence and Data Science, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay). I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Technology (B.Tech) in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from VIIT Pune, where I cultivated a strong foundation in engineering and science.

My academic journey now revolves around Online Learning and Generative AI. In the realm of Online Learning, I specialize in Multi-Armed Bandits, particularly in PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) settings, where I explore efficient decision-making strategies under uncertainty. In the space of Generative AI, I leverage online learning techniques to identify optimal Large Language Models (LLMs) to fine-tune for specific tasks, while also designing effective prompting strategies.

More recently, I’ve developed a growing interest in LLM Alignment and Multi-Agent Systems. I’m particularly intrigued by how agents—whether human or artificial—interact, cooperate, and compete in complex environments, and how alignment strategies can make these models more robust, reliable, and aligned with human values. These evolving interests open up exciting new research avenues that bridge learning theory, reinforcement learning, and real-world AI applications.

Outside of my academic pursuits, I’m passionate about probability theory, enjoying the nuances and depth it brings to understanding uncertainty. When I’m not immersed in research, you’ll often find me on the football or cricket field, soaking in the competitive spirit and teamwork that sports bring.

I feel grateful for the incredible mentors who have guided me along the way and for the opportunities that have come my way—having received Ph.D. offers from all the universities I applied to is a humbling reminder of the journey so far. As I continue down this path, I’m excited about what lies ahead and eager to explore new horizons in research.

Thank you for visiting my corner of the web! Feel free to explore my academic interests, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you’re passionate about these areas too.

Let’s connect and learn together!
