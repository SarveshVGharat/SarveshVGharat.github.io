In my research, I specialize in Online Learning with a dual focus, mainly exploring the theoretical novelties and:

<ul>
<li>Theoretical Novelties in Online Learning:
My research delves into the foundational aspects of Online Learning. I focus on developing novel algorithms and providing rigorous theoretical guarantees, particularly in the context of multi-armed bandits, statistical learning theory, and cost-aware decision-making processes. Some of the key challenges I address include:
  - Algorithmic Efficiency: Designing algorithms that balance exploration and exploitation for optimal decision-making in dynamic and uncertain environments.
  - Theoretical Guarantees: Establishing convergence guarantees and performance bounds to ensure the robustness of these algorithms in various settings, such as fixed-confidence bandits and large-scale model evaluations.
</li>

<li>Applications in Generative AI:
The second aspect of my research focuses on applying these theoretical advancements in the Generative AI space. I aim to optimize the performance and cost-efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) for various tasks. Key areas of application include:
  - Optimal LLM Selection: Developing efficient methods for identifying the best LLM for a given task while minimizing computational costs.
  - LLM Fine-tuning: Improving task-specific performance by fine-tuning LLMs in a cost-effective manner.
  - Prompt Optimization: Creating algorithms that help find the most effective prompts to improve the relevance and quality of generated responses by LLMs.
</li>
</ul>

Through this dual focus, my research bridges the gap between theory and practice, pushing the boundaries of Online Learning while enabling more effective and resource-efficient solutions in the Generative AI landscape.


<h4>Past Works</h4>
Along with Online Learning, I previously worked in observational astronomy, focusing on the analysis of data from space archives. I mainly used two different approaches to explore various aspects of the universe:
<ul>
<li>Statistical Analysis for Multiwavelength Astronomy:
One aspect of my work involved delving into multiwavelength data, which encompasses a range of electromagnetic radiation, including X-rays, extending beyond what's visible. I used mathematical techniques to find hidden patterns and gain insights into a wide range of cosmic events and objects. This approach was particularly useful when I studied high-energy events and tried to confirm the existence of planets outside our solar system, known as exoplanets.
</li>
<li>Deep Learning with Astronomical Data: In addition to traditional statistical methods, I also employed advanced computer techniques like transformer models and attention mechanisms. These cutting-edge tools helped me make sense of complex data from space. With deep learning, I could extract intricate details from diverse datasets, improving our understanding of the physical processes that govern the universe. I applied this approach to delve into high-energy observations, providing deeper insights into phenomena like supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, and active galactic nuclei.
</li>
</ul>
By combining statistical analysis and deep learning, I contributed to our expanding knowledge of the cosmos. I also tackled the challenges presented by the massive and varied datasets that astronomers deal with.
