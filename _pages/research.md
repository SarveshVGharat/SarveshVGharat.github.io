<h4>Online Learning</h4>
In my research, I specialize in Online Learning with a dual focus, exploring two distinct but complementary approaches to solve complex problems:
<ul>
<li>Multi-Armed Bandits and PAC Settings:
One facet of my work revolves around Multi-Armed Bandits (MABs) within the Probabilistically Approximately Correct (PAC) framework. I'm dedicated to the development of novel algorithms and the provision of rigorous theoretical guarantees. This area encompasses various challenges, including represented arm identification and the intricacies of linear bandits. My goal is to unlock the potential of MABs for smarter decision-making in dynamic environments.
</li>
<li>Crowdsourcing Task Allocation and Regret Optimization: The second facet of my research is centered on optimizing task allocation in crowdsourcing while minimizing costs. I strive to provide theoretical guarantees on regret, ensuring efficient resource utilization. This research involves the development of intelligent task allocation algorithms and the analysis of regret to enable data-driven decision-making in crowdsourcing scenarios.
</li>
</ul>
Through these two complementary research thrusts, I bridge theory and practice, advancing our understanding of online learning and revolutionizing the way we optimize crowdsourcing processes. My work addresses a spectrum of real-world challenges, from dynamic decision-making in uncertain environments to resource-efficient task allocation in crowdsourced endeavors. 

<h4>Observational Astronomy</h4>
Along with Online Learning I also work in observational astronomy. In observational astronomy I mainly focus on the analysis of data from space archives. I mainly use two different approaches to explore various aspects of the universe:
<ul>
<li>Statistical Analysis for Multiwavelength Astronomy:
One aspect of my work involves delving into multiwavelength data, which encompasses a range of electromagnetic radiation, including X-rays, extending beyond what's visible. I use mathematical techniques to find hidden patterns and gain insights into a wide range of cosmic events and objects. This approach is particularly useful when I'm studying high-energy events and trying to confirm the existence of planets outside our solar system, known as exoplanets.
</li>
<li>Deep Learning with Astronomical Data: In addition to traditional statistical methods, I also employ advanced computer techniques like transformer models and attention mechanisms. These cutting-edge tools help me make sense of complex data from space. With deep learning, I can extract intricate details from diverse datasets, improving our understanding of the physical processes that govern the universe. I apply this approach to delve into high-energy observations, providing deeper insights into phenomena like supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, and active galactic nuclei.
</li>
</ul>
By combining statistical analysis and deep learning, I contribute to our expanding knowledge of the cosmos. I also tackle the challenges presented by the massive and varied datasets that astronomers deal with.
